// Geek is learning about functions and calling a function with arguments. He learns that passing can take one of two forms: pass by value or pass by reference.

// Geek wishes to add 1 and 2, respectively, to the parameter passed by value and reference. Help Geek in fulfilling his goal.

class Solution {
    static int[] passedBy(int a, int b) {
        // code here
        return new int[]{a+1, b+2};
